    <p>Collecting coins is one of my favorite ways to spend my past time and I've been
      engaged with this hobby ever since I was a 10 year-old kid. I have several hundred
      different coins in my collection and this webiste gives a brief overview of some
      of the many different types of coins I have collected over the years. Most of
      the coins have been collected personally by me when I've travelled abroad to those
      countries, but there are some that I've recieved as gifts.
    </p>
    <p class="newline">Based on their geographic origins, most of my coins can categorized into the following types:</p>
    <ul>
      <a href="https://www.usmint.gov/learn/coin-and-medal-programs/circulating-coins">
      <li>American Coins</li></a>
      <li>European Coins</li>
      <li>Asian Coins</li>
    </ul>
