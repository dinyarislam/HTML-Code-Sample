    <p>Although I've never been to the US, over the years I've managed to acquire
      a couple different type of American coins namely Dimes and Pennies. Actually
      the oldest coin I own in my collection is a 1964 Penny.

    <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
    <p>U.S. Mint facilities in Denver and Philadelphia manufacture all of Americaâ€™s coins for commerce.
      The chart below shows the total number of circulating coins that the minted each year from the years 2016 to
      2020, and it's interesting to see that regardless of economic growth, the number of coins minted vary from year to
      year. For, example in 2016, the production was the highest in the 5 years with 16.0 billion coins
      being produced. In the next three years, the production dropped further each year to 14.9 billion
      in 2017, then to 13.1 billion in 2018 and finally reaching the lowest in 2019 with 11.9 billion coins.
      This number recovered a bit to reach 14.9 billion, although still less than in 2016.
